# SMRT16

Project site: https://smrt16.com

SMRT16 is an open-source, fully autonomous DApp on the Polygon blockchain that delivers a four-level referral affiliate program. It runs entirely on smart contracts, handling token purchases with USDT and distributing rewards instantly and transparently on-chain.

## What it demonstrates
- Solidity smart contracts for decentralized referral and loyalty systems
- Multi-level referral payouts baked directly into the token sale contract
- Autonomous, open-source DApp architecture on Polygon (fast, low-cost)
- AI-assisted internal/external audits for secure deployments
- Integrations for decentralized or centralized apps using SMRT16 logic

## Referral mechanics
- Up to 93.75% of each transaction is distributed to participants
- Four levels of rewards, decreasing by level (Level 1: 50% down to Level 4: 6.25%)
- Instant, on-chain payouts with no intermediaries

## Use cases
- Decentralized affiliate programs
- Blockchain-powered loyalty and rewards
- Crypto-integrated growth systems with accountable delivery from start to launch
