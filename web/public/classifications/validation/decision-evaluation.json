  "markdown": "# Validation Criteria — Decision / Evaluation Document\n\nType ids (planned):\n- `business_decision_memo`\n- `business_option_evaluation`\n\n## Goal\nStress-test decision documents before action:\n- make assumptions explicit\n- surface missing data\n- evaluate option tradeoffs consistently\n- detect recommendation bias and weak justification\n\n## What to extract (structured)\n- Decision question / objective\n- Options considered\n- Decision criteria\n- Assumptions\n- Evidence/data used\n- Risks and mitigations\n- Recommended option and rationale\n- Implementation constraints and dependencies\n\n## Validation checklist\n\n### A) Decision framing quality\n- Decision objective is explicit and measurable\n- Scope and constraints are defined\n- Success criteria are stated\n\n### B) Option completeness\n- At least two viable options assessed (or clear reason if not)\n- \"Do nothing\" baseline included or justified as excluded\n- Option descriptions are comparable (same level of detail)\n\n### C) Criteria and weighting\n- Criteria are explicit (cost, risk, timeline, impact, etc.)\n- Relative weighting or priority is stated\n- Flag hidden criteria introduced only in conclusion\n\n### D) Assumptions and data sufficiency\n- Extract assumptions and confidence level\n- Flag assumptions lacking evidence\n- Flag material missing data that could change outcome\n\n### E) Risk realism\n- Risks include likelihood + impact framing\n- Mitigations are specific and assigned to owners\n- Flag one-sided optimism (benefits listed, risks shallow)\n\n### F) Recommendation integrity\n- Recommended option aligns with scored criteria\n- Flag recommendation that contradicts analysis table/text\n- Flag irreversible decisions without fallback/rollback plan\n\n## Output schema (draft)\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"decision_evaluation_validation\",\n  \"decision\": {\n    \"question\": \"\",\n    \"objective\": \"\",\n    \"constraints\": [\"\"]\n  },\n  \"options\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"opt1\",\n      \"name\": \"\",\n      \"summary\": \"\",\n      \"pros\": [\"\"],\n      \"cons\": [\"\"],\n      \"risks\": [{\"risk\": \"\", \"likelihood\": \"low|medium|high\", \"impact\": \"low|medium|high\"}]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"criteria\": [\n    {\n      \"criterion\": \"\",\n      \"weight\": null,\n      \"scores\": [{\"optionId\": \"opt1\", \"score\": null, \"justification\": \"\"}]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"assumptions\": [{\"assumption\": \"\", \"confidence\": \"low|medium|high\", \"evidence\": \"\"}],\n  \"missingData\": [{\"dataNeeded\": \"\", \"why\": \"\", \"impactOnDecision\": \"\"}],\n  \"recommendation\": {\n    \"optionId\": \"opt1\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\",\n    \"fallbackPlan\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"severity\": \"high|medium|low\",\n      \"message\": \"\",\n      \"evidence\": [{\"page\": 1, \"quote\": \"\"}]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Red flags (high severity)\n- recommendation does not match evaluation results\n- critical assumptions have no supporting data\n- only one option considered without justification\n- no fallback for high-impact irreversible decision\n\n## Disclaimer\nInformational analysis only, not financial/legal/operational advice.\n",
