  "markdown": "# Validation Criteria — Associations Constitution / Charter / Bylaws\n\nType id: `governance_association_constitution` (planned)\n\n## Goal\nSurface hidden power structures in “formal” governance documents:\n- membership and expulsion power\n- voting rules and quorum traps\n- amendment mechanisms\n- board vs members authority conflicts\n- missing dispute/dissolution clauses\n- silent areas (finance control, asset ownership)\n\n## What to extract (structured)\n- Membership classes + eligibility\n- Admission/removal/expulsion procedures\n- Member voting rights + meeting rules\n- Quorum rules\n- Board powers + delegation\n- Amendment procedure\n- Dispute resolution process\n- Dissolution/winding up process\n- Finance controls + asset ownership statements\n\n## Validation checklist\n\n### A) Membership vs expulsion power\n- Criteria for membership clear\n- Grounds for expulsion clear\n- Procedural fairness: notice, right to respond, appeal\n- Flag expulsion power without process\n\n### B) Voting and quorum traps\n- Voting rights per member class\n- Quorum definition and how it can be met/blocked\n- Proxy voting rules\n- Special resolution thresholds\n- Chair casting vote rules\n\n### C) Amendment mechanism\n- Who can propose amendments\n- Notice period\n- Required majority\n- Flag if board can amend core rules unilaterally\n\n### D) Authority conflicts\n- Map board powers vs member powers\n- Flag contradictory clauses or unclear precedence\n\n### E) Missing clauses / silent areas\nFlag if missing or unclear:\n- dispute resolution / internal appeals\n- dissolution / asset distribution\n- finance controls (approvals, dual sign, audit)\n- asset ownership / IP ownership\n\n## Output schema (draft)\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"association_constitution_validation\",\n  \"membership\": {\"classes\": [], \"expulsion\": \"\"},\n  \"voting\": {\"quorum\": \"\", \"proxy\": \"\", \"thresholds\": \"\"},\n  \"powers\": {\"board\": [], \"members\": []},\n  \"amendment\": {\"who\": \"\", \"notice\": \"\", \"threshold\": \"\"},\n  \"dispute\": {\"exists\": null, \"summary\": \"\"},\n  \"dissolution\": {\"exists\": null, \"summary\": \"\"},\n  \"silentAreas\": [\"\"],\n  \"findings\": [{\"severity\": \"high|medium|low\", \"message\": \"\", \"evidence\": [{\"page\": 1, \"quote\": \"\"}]}]\n}\n```\n\n## Red flags (high severity)\n- expulsion without process/appeal\n- quorum/voting rules enabling capture by a small group\n- board can amend core constitution without member vote\n- missing dissolution clause\n",
