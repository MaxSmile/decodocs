# Use Cases

Customer-facing reference for use-case positioning across:
- `snapsign.com.au/use-cases`
- `decodocs.com/uses-cases`
- `decodocs.com/use-cases/*`

This page is canonical for messaging alignment.

## Positioning Core

Primary positioning statement:
- Understand before you commit.

Decision trigger to emphasize:
- "This clause cost me money before."

Universal risk language to keep consistent in all use-case pages:
- Auto-renewal traps
- Personal guarantee clauses
- Unlimited liability
- Payment terms
- Termination penalties
- IP transfer

## SnapSign Hubs (Pain-Based)

Canonical hub:
- `/use-cases/`

Required pages:
- `/use-cases/before-signing-a-contract/`
- `/use-cases/freelancers-agencies/`
- `/use-cases/small-business-owners/`
- `/use-cases/vendor-management/`
- `/use-cases/investor-agreements/`

Page intent:
- Each page maps specific contract types to specific risk clauses.
- Copy must be recognition-first, not generic feature-first.

## DecoDocs Use Cases (Product Site)

Canonical strategic page:
- `/uses-cases/`

Strategic bucket framing:
- Before You Sign a Contract
- When Running a Business
- When Reviewing Financial Documents

Detailed segments currently represented:
- Contracts and agreements
- Legal and corporate documents
- Financial and compliance documents
- Startup and business validation
- HR and recruitment
- Everyday documents

Persona/SEO pages currently represented under `/use-cases/*`:
- startup-founders
- procurement-teams
- freelancers-agencies
- small-business-owners
- hr-people-ops
- property-managers
- legal-teams
- finance-teams

## Mapping Rule (SnapSign -> DecoDocs)

- before-signing-a-contract -> uses-cases strategic buckets + legal/procurement/persona pages
- freelancers-agencies -> `decodocs.com/use-cases/freelancers-agencies`
- small-business-owners -> `decodocs.com/use-cases/small-business-owners`
- vendor-management -> procurement/legal/property flows
- investor-agreements -> `decodocs.com/use-cases/startup-founders` (+ finance/legal when relevant)

## Content Guardrails

Do:
- Lead with consequence and risk.
- Name the clause type directly.
- Show "when this applies" and "what it can cost."

Do not:
- Lead with generic "PDF summarizer" language.
- Position around school/essay rewriting.
- Use internal platform/deployment language in customer-facing docs.

## Maintenance

When use-case pages change on SnapSign or DecoDocs:
1. Update this document first.
2. Update site pages.
3. Verify hub links and cross-links still map correctly.
