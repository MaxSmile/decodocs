# DecoDocs Roadmap (Rolling)

_Last updated: February 10, 2026_

## Source of truth
Global planning lives in the MasterMind repo under `PROJECTS/snap-sign-pte-ltd/ROADMAP.md`. This file mirrors the
rolling plan for the implementation repo.

## Planning approach
- Plan in short, numbered priorities rather than time horizons.
- Re-evaluate weekly based on shipped value and telemetry.
- Prefer smaller, shippable increments over large phases.

## Product track (prioritized)
1. Stabilize PDF open and analyze flows with predictable gating and errors.
2. Finish auth linking UX and pricing upgrade flow.
3. Admin v1 for plans, limits, and feature flags.
4. Tighten usage telemetry and cost visibility.
5. Expand prompt evaluation set and regression checks.
6. Google Drive integration (open mode, Pro upload optional).
7. OneDrive integration (same UX model as Drive).
8. iCloud Drive file picker support (open mode).
9. Email-to-sign MVP (stateless Free flow, Pro storage optional).
10. Multi-document analysis and cross-document checks (Pro).
11. DOCX support (Pro only, explicit cost gating).
12. Mobile share-to-DecoDocs entry points.
13. Full signing and verification workflow (deferred).

## Enterprise track (prioritized)
E1. Define enterprise requirements and procurement checklist.

E9. SIEM integration.
E10. Data residency story and subprocessor list.
E11. Admin dashboard for usage, limits, and feature toggles.
E12. Async processing with queue + retry and provider fallback.
