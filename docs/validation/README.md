# DecoDocs — Validation Criteria Library

This folder contains **type-specific validation criteria** (checklists) used by DecoDocs.

Principles:
- Criteria are **explicit and versioned** (git)
- Prompts (DSPy or otherwise) must implement these criteria; criteria are not hidden in prompts
- UI may show a summary of criteria to users (“What we check for this type”)

## Files
- `invoice.md`
- `job-offer.md`
- `company-policy.md`
